Created and performed by Alex Romania

Description

This physically vulnerable choreography frames the male body between violence and pleasure -- a microphone is bound to the body and swung from the pelvis evoking forms in the realm of BDSM, pornography, athletics, games, and flagellation. Through genital hypnosis and rigorous discomfort, this is a dance of (narcissistic) pleasure and (quiet) longing, (self) mutilation and (self) care. A dance to flatten and complexify the male body, to tenderize the flesh, to move beyond and to newly inhabit — a phallic solo to recompose the phallus.

Artistic Statement:

Humans engage in radical, normalized, spiritual, and institutionalized actions every day to exorcise dangerous and healthy demons from (their) bodies. We sweat, laugh, protest, screw to liberation, abuse, annihilate cultures, and systematically oppress. We shit, we piss, we cry. At the core of exorcism (not necessarily religious exorcism), is to purge, expel, and move. Fear causes exorcism of lives. Exorcism polarizes good/evil, pure/vile, light/dark. The same forces of cultural colonization that empires war over. Exorcism destroys cultures, saves lives, and builds identity. While functioning as a force to separate the evil from the good, it condones invisible evil under the guise of godwar. This polarization sanctions demagogues and lifts them to demigod status. It justifies culturally practiced vilification, which leads to mass distortions of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, and spurs hysterical, insane, illogical, and fear driven violence. My practice investigates the dangerous and functional role of value systems in relationship to social choreography (the choreography of systems - economies, isms, government's, gender... etc.) mutating systems through performance, movement, improvisation, action, pursuing alternative possibilities for cohabitating space. Performing my work is to navigate through a psychedelic constellation of scores. Thrust between the internal experience and external reality(?), it is negotiating what, why, how, and when we perform while performing scores that catapult the performer into intentional confusion and discomfort. My work pursues an altered inhabitancy of the the good/bad spectrum to liberate the governed body. Investigating a body possessed by cultural debris, overloaded with the invisible everyday and it’s social, global, and personal ingestions, reckoning with itself in a purging state, consuming and breaking apart. The multiple body in exorcism.
