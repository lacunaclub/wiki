probably should watch [carrie](/carrie "wikilink"), and [badlands](/badlands "wikilink").

dreaded phone call. doughnutz. workshop. got snack (snakez) for the workshop. pretzel rodz, wasabi almondz, honey roasted peanuts, chocolate, and pineapple chunkz. juice for myself. listening to a mixtape that matt/[consumer](/consumer "wikilink") gave me. as followz:
