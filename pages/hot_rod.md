ugh. wish i did not see this. so much violence. a weird tale of patriarchy. male-ness and heteronormativity run rampant. i for some reason thought this movie was made in the 80s. it's got this group-of-comedy-dudez vibe that seemed to get a lot of traction in the 2000s.

sissy spacek was hardly ever on screen.
